# A Day in the Life of a Dev 🤓

• **MY BRAIN**: Victor, Listen... What happened the other day!

• **ME**: (Surprised, Thinking... was it not there?) I’m all about optimizing **state management** and ensuring top performance with **React Query**.

• **MY BRAIN**: You mean making sure every bit of state is handled efficiently and all data is cached to reduce unnecessary fetches, right?

• **ME**: Yeah... (Answering amicably so as to end the conversation). It keeps the app fast and responsive. Plus, optimizing the **database queries** to reduce latency with **indexing** and **query optimization** is another big win.

• **MY BRAIN**: Yep! Not to forget how we’re using **Promise.all** to fetch data in parallel, reducing wait times. That makes everything smoother...

• **ME**: (Still trying to keep the tempo cool...) True, but don't forget how we validate all of this with **Cypress** end-to-end tests and **Jest** for unit tests, ensuring every part of the app runs as expected. We've written countless tests to cover all our core functionalities.

• **MY BRAIN**: Oh yes! **Jest** with **React Testing Library** has been a lifesaver for catching potential issues early, especially when dealing with complex interactions...

• **ME**: (Liking the conversation more ☕) And how about **Cypress**? Testing real-world user interactions is a game-changer for frontend stability.

• **MY BRAIN**: Speaking of the frontend... you’ve been translating Figma prototypes into pixel-perfect web pages regularly, haven’t you?

• **ME**: Yep! Ensuring that every design element looks exactly as envisioned while collaborating closely with product managers to bring ideas to life is part of the fun.

• **MY BRAIN**: It’s a well-rounded effort—from design to deployment—keeping things efficient and visually appealing...

• **ME**: And even though we focus heavily on frontend with **React.js**, **Typescript** and **Next.js**, let’s not forget the backend optimizations with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and • **MongoDB**...

• **MY BRAIN**: (Takes a sip of coffee ☕) Right! Keeping both sides efficient and clean is our goal. Whether it's state management or database queries, performance always comes first.

• **ME**: Yep! Want to see more? Check out my dedicated projects page on my portfolio...

• **MY BRAIN**: Shouldn't you be writing more blogs to share everything we've been learning?

• **ME**: Absolutely... Writing blogs has been a great way to communicate our learning, whether it's about **state management**, **database optimization**, or **testing strategies**...

• **MY BRAIN**: Yeah, it's also a good way to reinforce our understanding and help others along the way.

• **ME**: Exactly... Plus, it’s fun sharing insights and projects. I’ve already written some pieces, and more are on the way.

• **MY BRAIN**: Perfect! Make sure they know where to find the blog.

• **ME**: No worries. I’ve got that covered...

• **MY BRAIN**: Why didn’t you use a fancy shield for your blog?

• **ME**: 🙄 Shields.io didn’t have one...

• **MY BRAIN**: Then create one for them! 😤

• **ME**: I would've added more analytics like **Recent Activity** and **GitHub Stats**, but sadly... the work we do in organization "private" repositories isn’t visible to everyone.

• **MY BRAIN**: So all that hard work goes unnoticed by the world?

• **ME**: Yep, it’s hidden behind the scenes... 😭

• **MY BRAIN**: Oh well, as long as we know the impact, right? 🤷🏽‍♂️

• **ME**: (Feeling a little proud...) True, but it would’ve been nice to show off a little! 😤
