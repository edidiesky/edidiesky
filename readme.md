# A Day in the Life of a Dev 🤓

**MY BRAIN**: Victor, Listen What happened the other day!

**ME**: ( Suprised, Thinking was it not there) I’m all about optimizing **state management** and ensuring top performance with **React Query**.

**MY BRAIN**: You mean making sure every bit of state is handled efficiently and all data is cached to reduce unnecessary fetches, right?

**ME**: Yeah (Answering amicably so as to end the conversation). It keeps the app fast and responsive. Plus, optimizing the **database queries** to reduce latency with **indexing** and **query optimization** is another big win.

**MY BRAIN**: Yep! Not to forget how we’re using **Promise.all** to fetch data in parallel, reducing wait times. That makes everything smoother.

**ME**: (Still trying to keep the tempo cool) True, but don't forget how we validate all of this with **Cypress** end-to-end tests and **Jest** for unit tests, ensuring every part of the app runs as expected. We've written countless tests to cover all our core functionalities.

**MY BRAIN**: Oh yes! **Jest** with **React Testing Library** has been a lifesaver for catching potential issues early, especially when dealing with complex interactions.

**ME**: And how about **Cypress**? Testing real-world user interactions is a game-changer for frontend stability.

**MY BRAIN**: Speaking of the frontend, you’ve been translating Figma prototypes into pixel-perfect web pages regularly, haven’t you?

**ME**: Yep! Ensuring that every design element looks exactly as envisioned while collaborating closely with product managers to bring ideas to life is part of the fun.

**MY BRAIN**: It’s a well-rounded effort—from design to deployment—keeping things efficient and visually appealing!

**ME**: And even though we focus heavily on frontend with **React.js**, **Typescript** and **Next.js**, let’s not forget the backend optimizations with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**.

**MY BRAIN**: (Takes a sip of coffee ☕) Right! Keeping both sides efficient and clean is our goal. Whether it's state management or database queries, performance always comes first.

**ME**: Yep! Want to see more? Check out my dedicated projects page on my portfolio.

**MY BRAIN**: Shouldn't you be writing more blogs to share everything we've been learning?

**ME**: Absolutely! Writing blogs has been a great way to communicate our learning, whether it's about **state management**, **database optimization**, or **testing strategies**.

**MY BRAIN**: Yeah, it's also a good way to reinforce our understanding and help others along the way.

**ME**: Exactly. Plus, it’s fun sharing insights and projects. I’ve already written some pieces, and more are on the way.

**MY BRAIN**: Perfect! Make sure they know where to find the blog.

**ME**: No worries. I’ve got that covered.

**MY BRAIN**: Why didn’t you use a fancy shield for your blog?

**ME**: 🙄 Shields.io didn’t have one.

**MY BRAIN**: Then create one for them! 😤

**ME**: I would've added more analytics like **Recent Activity** and **GitHub Stats**, but sadly, the work we do in organization "private" repositories isn’t visible to everyone.

**MY BRAIN**: So all that hard work goes unnoticed by the world?

**ME**: Yep, it’s hidden behind the scenes 😭.

**MY BRAIN**: Oh well, as long as we know the impact, right? 🤷🏽‍♂️

**ME**: True, but it would’ve been nice to show off a little! 😤
